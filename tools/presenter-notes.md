# Presenter

- get the people's names and desires or some trivia about themselves (Me - Georgi (joro) about to be a Christmas-time dad while skiing)
- talk about the app - what is it and why is it
  - we use an actual app to get as close to real-world experience as possible
  - mock data for the component lever performance
  - server seems to be wiped mornings
- I'll show the performance issues and point out the solution
- Then you'll have 10 minutes to try it out yourself and we'll take questions
- performance on the component level
  - lots of change detect cycles are the worst contributing factor to low performance
- performance on the module level
- what is the difference and why address both
- what to expect
  - a few tasks
  - a review after each task
    - volunteers to share their code and review would take the most out of this
